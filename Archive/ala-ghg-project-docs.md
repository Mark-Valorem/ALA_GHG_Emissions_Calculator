# Australian Lubricant Association GHG Emissions Calculator Project

## Project Overview

The Australian Lubricant Association (ALA) has successfully developed a comprehensive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions calculator specifically tailored for Australian lubricant blending facilities. This tool adapts the proven United States ILMA (Independent Lubricant Manufacturers Association) calculator model to meet Australian regulatory requirements and environmental reporting standards.

### Project Vision

Creating an accessible, accurate tool that empowers lubricant blending facilities across Australia to track their carbon footprint using locally relevant methodologies and emission factors. The calculator focuses on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, aligning with the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme requirements.

### Key Objectives

The project successfully delivered a solution that serves three critical purposes:

1. **Accessibility**: Provides facility managers with an intuitive way to calculate emissions without requiring expertise in carbon accounting
2. **Compliance**: Ensures all calculations comply with Australian NGER methodologies rather than US EPA standards
3. **Usability**: Maintains the simplicity and user-friendly design that made the original ILMA tool successful

## Current Project Status: COMPLETE âœ…

The Australian Lubricant Association GHG Emissions Calculator is now feature-complete and ready for deployment. All planned functionality has been implemented, tested, and refined based on user feedback and professional requirements.

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis âœ… Complete

We began by analysing six reference documents to understand both the US approach and Australian requirements:

- The ILMA sample calculator provided our functional blueprint, showing how monthly data entry could be structured for ease of use
- The Clean Energy Regulator documents gave us the Australian emission factors and methodologies we needed to implement
- Through this analysis, we identified key differences between US and Australian approaches, particularly in units of measurement (metric vs imperial) and emission factor calculations

### Phase 2: Design and Development âœ… Complete

We successfully created a web-based calculator that captures all required functionality:

- **Responsive design** that works across all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers
- **Comprehensive data entry** sections for natural gas, electricity, diesel, and LPG consumption
- **Automatic calculations** performing all necessary conversions between activity data and emissions
- **Embedded NGER emission factors** ensuring compliance with Australian standards
- **Professional branding** with ALA logo integration and official attribution

The design philosophy focused on progressive enhancement, meaning the core calculation functionality works independently of any visual enhancements. This ensures reliability even in restricted corporate environments where certain web features might be blocked.

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement âœ… Complete

Testing confirmed that the calculator performs accurately and professionally:

- Successfully ran test calculations showing that 26,000 cubic metres of natural gas correctly converts to 52.6 tonnes of COâ‚‚-equivalent emissions
- Visual charts display properly when the HTML file is run locally, providing clear pie charts, doughnut charts, and trend lines
- The tool correctly handles both calendar year and financial year reporting periods, automatically adjusting month labels as needed
- Column-based tab navigation improves data entry efficiency by allowing users to tab down columns rather than across rows
- Print functionality produces clean, professional reports suitable for filing and compliance documentation

### Phase 4: Professional Enhancements âœ… Complete

Based on user feedback and professional requirements, we implemented several crucial enhancements:

- **Contact Information Section**: Added comprehensive fields for preparer details, ensuring accountability and traceability
- **Number Formatting**: Implemented thousands separators throughout the calculator for improved readability
- **Enhanced Footer**: Created professional ALA branding and attribution
- **Print Optimization**: Added CSS to hide navigation buttons when printing, creating clean reports
- **Website Integration**: Updated all links to point to the correct ALA website (https://lubeassoc.com.au/)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

The calculator uses a pure client-side approach, meaning all calculations happen in the user's web browser. This design provides several advantages:

- **No server costs** or maintenance requirements
- **Complete data privacy** since information never leaves the user's computer
- **Instant calculations** without network delays
- **Offline capability** once the page is loaded

### Technology Stack

We built the calculator using standard web technologies to ensure maximum compatibility:

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| HTML5 | Structure and semantic markup |
| Tailwind CSS | Responsive styling that adapts to different screen sizes |
| Vanilla JavaScript | All calculations and user interactions |
| Chart.js | Visual representations (when available) |

### Key Features Implemented

The calculator now includes a comprehensive set of features that make it a professional-grade tool for emissions reporting. The facility information capture system collects essential details including facility name, state location for electricity factors, reporting period selection, and year specification. The contact information section ensures accountability by recording who prepared the calculations, their title and department, contact details, and the preparation date.

For data entry, we implemented an intuitive monthly input table with yellow-highlighted cells for clarity, column-based tab navigation for efficient data entry, automatic annual totals calculation, and real-time updates as users enter data. The emissions calculations follow NGER methodology precisely, converting activity data to energy content in gigajoules, applying appropriate emission factors for each fuel type, separating Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions correctly, and using state-specific electricity emission factors.

The results presentation includes multiple visualization options. Users see prominent emission totals with thousands separators for clarity, detailed breakdowns showing consumption, energy, and emissions, optional charts including pie charts, doughnut charts, and trend lines, and a professional print layout that removes web elements and formats content for A4 paper.

### Emission Factor Implementation

The calculator embeds representative NGER emission factors directly in the code:

```javascript
// Energy content factors (GJ per unit)
energyContent: {
    naturalGas: 0.0393,  // GJ per mÂ³
    diesel: 0.0386,      // GJ per L
    lpg: 0.0262,         // GJ per L
    electricity: 0.0036  // GJ per kWh
}

// Emission factors (t COâ‚‚e per GJ)
fuelEmissions: {
    naturalGas: 0.0515,  // t COâ‚‚e per GJ
    diesel: 0.0702,      // t COâ‚‚e per GJ
    lpg: 0.0600         // t COâ‚‚e per GJ
}

// State electricity factors (kg COâ‚‚e per kWh)
electricityByState: {
    'NSW': 0.68,
    'VIC': 0.79,
    'QLD': 0.73,
    'SA': 0.25,
    'WA-SWIS': 0.53,
    'TAS': 0.12,
    'NT': 0.54
}
```

## Understanding the User Experience

The calculator provides an intuitive workflow that respects how facility managers actually work with their data. When users first open the calculator, they're greeted with the familiar ALA logo, confirming they're using an official industry tool. The layout guides them naturally through the process, from entering facility details to viewing their emissions results.

The column-based tab navigation represents a thoughtful enhancement based on real-world usage patterns. Users typically have their utility bills organized by type, so they can enter all twelve months of natural gas data before moving to electricity, then diesel, and finally LPG. This reduces context switching and speeds up data entry considerably.

Professional formatting touches throughout the calculator build confidence in the results. Numbers display with thousands separators, making large values instantly readable. The preparation date automatically fills with today's date, preventing a common oversight. Contact fields ensure accountability, particularly important for larger organizations where multiple people might prepare emissions reports.
