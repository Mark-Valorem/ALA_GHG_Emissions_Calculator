# Australian Lubricant Association GHG Emissions Calculator Project

## Project Overview

The Australian Lubricant Association (ALA) has commissioned the development of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions calculator specifically tailored for Australian lubricant blending facilities. This tool adapts the successful United States ILMA (Independent Lubricant Manufacturers Association) calculator model to meet Australian regulatory requirements and environmental reporting standards.

### Project Vision

Creating an accessible, accurate tool that empowers lubricant blending facilities across Australia to track their carbon footprint using locally relevant methodologies and emission factors. The calculator focuses on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, aligning with the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme requirements.

### Key Objectives

The project aims to deliver a solution that serves three critical purposes:

1. **Accessibility**: Provides facility managers with an intuitive way to calculate emissions without requiring expertise in carbon accounting
2. **Compliance**: Ensures all calculations comply with Australian NGER methodologies rather than US EPA standards
3. **Usability**: Maintains the simplicity and user-friendly design that made the original ILMA tool successful

## Current Project Status

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis ‚úÖ Complete

We began by analysing six reference documents to understand both the US approach and Australian requirements:

- The ILMA sample calculator provided our functional blueprint, showing how monthly data entry could be structured for ease of use
- The Clean Energy Regulator documents gave us the Australian emission factors and methodologies we needed to implement
- Through this analysis, we identified key differences between US and Australian approaches, particularly in units of measurement (metric vs imperial) and emission factor calculations

### Phase 2: Design and Development ‚úÖ Complete

We've successfully created a web-based calculator that captures all required functionality:

- **Responsive design** that works across all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers
- **Comprehensive data entry** sections for natural gas, electricity, diesel, and LPG consumption
- **Automatic calculations** performing all necessary conversions between activity data and emissions
- **Embedded NGER emission factors** ensuring compliance with Australian standards

The design philosophy focused on progressive enhancement, meaning the core calculation functionality works independently of any visual enhancements. This ensures reliability even in restricted corporate environments where certain web features might be blocked.

### Phase 3: Initial Testing ‚úÖ Complete

Testing has confirmed that the calculator performs accurately:

- Successfully ran test calculations showing that 26,000 cubic metres of natural gas correctly converts to 52.6 tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent emissions
- Visual charts display properly when the HTML file is run locally, providing clear pie charts, doughnut charts, and trend lines
- The tool correctly handles both calendar year and financial year reporting periods, automatically adjusting month labels as needed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

The calculator uses a pure client-side approach, meaning all calculations happen in the user's web browser. This design provides several advantages:

- **No server costs** or maintenance requirements
- **Complete data privacy** since information never leaves the user's computer
- **Instant calculations** without network delays
- **Offline capability** once the page is loaded

### Technology Stack

We built the calculator using standard web technologies to ensure maximum compatibility:

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| HTML5 | Structure and semantic markup |
| Tailwind CSS | Responsive styling that adapts to different screen sizes |
| Vanilla JavaScript | All calculations and user interactions |
| Chart.js | Visual representations (when available) |

### Emission Factor Implementation

The calculator embeds representative NGER emission factors directly in the code:

```javascript
// Energy content factors (GJ per unit)
energyContent: {
    naturalGas: 0.0393,  // GJ per m¬≥
    diesel: 0.0386,      // GJ per L
    lpg: 0.0262,         // GJ per L
    electricity: 0.0036  // GJ per kWh
}

// Emission factors (t CO‚ÇÇe per GJ)
fuelEmissions: {
    naturalGas: 0.0515,  // t CO‚ÇÇe per GJ
    diesel: 0.0702,      // t CO‚ÇÇe per GJ
    lpg: 0.0600         // t CO‚ÇÇe per GJ
}

// State electricity factors (kg CO‚ÇÇe per kWh)
electricityByState: {
    'NSW': 0.68,
    'VIC': 0.79,
    'QLD': 0.73,
    'SA': 0.25,
    'WA-SWIS': 0.53,
    'TAS': 0.12,
    'NT': 0.54
}
```

## Understanding the Calculation Flow

The calculator follows a three-step process that mirrors official NGER methodology:

### Step 1: Data Entry
Users enter their monthly consumption data for each fuel type. The yellow-highlighted input cells make it immediately clear where data should be entered.

### Step 2: Energy Conversion
The tool converts physical units (cubic metres, litres, kilowatt-hours) into energy content measured in gigajoules. This standardisation allows different fuel types to be compared on an equal basis.

### Step 3: Emissions Calculation
Emissions are calculated by multiplying energy content by the appropriate emission factors, considering all greenhouse gases and converting them to CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent values.

This approach ensures complete transparency. Users can see exactly how their fuel consumption translates to emissions, building understanding and trust in the results.

## Project Deliverables Status

### Primary Deliverable: Web Application ‚úÖ Delivered

The HTML-based calculator is complete and functional. It provides:

- Facility information capture (name, location, reporting period)
- Monthly data entry for multiple fuel types
- Automatic emissions calculations using NGER factors
- Visual representation through charts and detailed tables
- Responsive design for all devices

### Secondary Deliverable: Excel Version ‚è≥ Not Yet Created

While the project brief mentioned an Excel fallback option, the web version has proven robust enough that an Excel version may not be necessary. However, this remains available as an option if some ALA members strongly prefer spreadsheet-based tools or have extremely restrictive IT environments.

## Critical Next Steps

### 1. Emission Factor Verification üî¥ Highest Priority

Before deployment, the emission factors must be updated with the latest official values:

- [ ] Obtain latest NGER Measurement Determination from Clean Energy Regulator
