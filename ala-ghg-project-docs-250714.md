# Australian Lubricant Association GHG Emissions Calculator Project

## Project Overview

The Australian Lubricant Association (ALA) has commissioned the development of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions calculator specifically tailored for Australian lubricant blending facilities. This tool adapts the successful United States ILMA (Independent Lubricant Manufacturers Association) calculator model to meet Australian regulatory requirements and environmental reporting standards.

### Project Vision

Creating an accessible, accurate tool that empowers lubricant blending facilities across Australia to track their carbon footprint using locally relevant methodologies and emission factors. The calculator focuses on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, aligning with the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme requirements.

### Key Objectives

The project aims to deliver a solution that serves three critical purposes:

1. **Accessibility**: Provides facility managers with an intuitive way to calculate emissions without requiring expertise in carbon accounting
2. **Compliance**: Ensures all calculations comply with Australian NGER methodologies rather than US EPA standards
3. **Usability**: Maintains the simplicity and user-friendly design that made the original ILMA tool successful

## Current Project Status - Version 3.0 Released (July 2025)

### âœ… Phase 1: Requirements Analysis - Complete

We began by analysing six reference documents to understand both the US approach and Australian requirements:

- The ILMA sample calculator provided our functional blueprint, showing how monthly data entry could be structured for ease of use
- The Clean Energy Regulator documents gave us the Australian emission factors and methodologies we needed to implement
- Through this analysis, we identified key differences between US and Australian approaches, particularly in units of measurement (metric vs imperial) and emission factor calculations

### âœ… Phase 2: Initial Development (v1.0) - Complete

The first version established the core calculation engine with basic functionality for tracking standard emission sources.

### âœ… Phase 3: Enhanced Features (v2.0-v2.1) - Complete

Version 2.0 and 2.1 introduced significant enhancements including:

- Expanded emission sources (waste oil burning, refrigerant leakage, welding gases)
- Production metrics for emissions intensity calculations
- Comprehensive emission reduction initiatives tracking
- Contact information management
- Enhanced reporting capabilities

### âœ… Phase 4: Usability Improvements (v3.0) - Complete

Version 3.0 addressed critical usability issues identified during user testing:

#### The Table Width Challenge

The primary issue was that the monthly data entry table had grown too wide with 13 columns, making it difficult to use on standard screens and impossible to print properly. Users reported:
- Excessive horizontal scrolling required for data entry
- Inability to see all data at once, increasing error risk
- Print outputs being cut off, making reports unusable for audits
- Mobile and tablet devices being virtually unusable

#### The Implemented Solution

We implemented a sophisticated hybrid approach that maintains all functionality while dramatically improving usability:

1. **Split Table Architecture**
   - Separated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions into distinct tables
   - Organized Scope 1 into logical subcategories (Stationary, Mobile, Other)
   - Created view toggle buttons allowing users to switch between Detailed, Summary, and Print Preview modes

2. **Responsive Design Enhancements**
   - Tables now adapt properly to screen size
   - Mobile devices show appropriately sized inputs
   - Tablet users can enter data efficiently in the field

3. **Print Optimization**
   - Created a special consolidated print view that fits perfectly on A4 landscape paper
   - Fixed the duplicate footer issue that occurred when generating executive summaries
   - Ensured all data is captured in printed reports for audit trails

4. **Data Structure Modernization**
   - Implemented a nested data structure for better organization
   - Created automatic migration for users with existing v2 data
   - Improved data validation and error checking
