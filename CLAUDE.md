## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- All functionality contained in single HTML file
- JavaScript embedded in `<script>` tags at bottom
- CSS embedded in `<style>` tags in header
- Uses vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks beyond Chart.js)
- Tailwind CSS classes for styling

### Emission Factors
**Current Version**: NGA 2024 Edition (National Greenhouse Accounts Factors)
- Natural Gas: 0.0393 GJ/mÂ³, 51.53 kg COâ‚‚e/GJ
- Diesel: 0.0386 GJ/L, 70.20 kg COâ‚‚e/GJ  
- Electricity: State-specific factors (NSW/ACT: 0.66, VIC: 0.77, QLD: 0.71, SA: 0.23, etc.)

2. Modify JavaScript data structures
3. Add emission factors for new sources
4. Update calculation functions
5. Modify report templates to include new sources
6. **Add test cases to automated suite for new sources**

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Use Tailwind CSS classes for consistency
2. Maintain scope color coding (Scope 1: blue, Scope 2: green)
3. Test responsive behavior on all screen sizes
4. Ensure print layouts remain functional

## Deployment Process

### File Naming Convention
- Production releases: `ala-ghg-calculator-v[major].[minor].html`

2. Code review for accuracy and security
3. User testing with representative facilities
4. Cross-browser compatibility testing
5. Print/export functionality verification
6. Documentation updates
7. **Verify test results show 100% pass rate** before deployment
